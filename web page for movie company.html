        <p>1.Critic's Rating:
3.5/5
Brahmastra Story: Shiva, a young DJ in Mumbai, discovers that he’s born with a special power that makes him immune and akin to fire. He gradually discovers the secrets behind his own existence that are also tied to a string of mythological incidents. How that changes the course of his life forms the rest of the narrative.
Brahmastra Review: A young, orphaned DJ, Shiva (Ranbir Kapoor), leads a happy life, full of light, around a bunch of orphaned kids. His special connection with fire - it doesn’t inflame him - and a host of visuals that appear before him periodically when he shuts his eyes, suck him into a world of superpowers. While there’s a mythological background to this, it also, gradually, connects Shiva to the story of his parents, which changes the course of his life. His search for love and light puts him on the path to destroy evil forces, and discover his true potential.</p>

<p>2.After a long wait, Kartik Aaryan and Tabu starrer, Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2, hit theaters on Friday.
Helmed by Anees Bazmee, it is a loosely connected sequel to Priyadarshan's Bhool Bhulaiyaa (2007) which featured actors Akshay Kumar and Vidya Balan in the lead.
The prequel defined the horror-comedy genre with the lead actors giving stellar performances, but the sequel barely copes up</p>
